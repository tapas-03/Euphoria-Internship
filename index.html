            Rabindranath Tagore (1861 - 1941), also known as "Gurudev" and the "Bard of Bengal," was a Bengali polymath. He was a poet, philosopher, composer, painter, and educationalist who reshaped Indian art and literature in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Born in Calcutta, he started writing poetry at age eight. Tagore is best known for Gitanjali (Song Offerings), which earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. He composed over 2,000 songs, called Rabindra Sangeet. He composed the national anthems of India ("Jana Gana Mana") and Bangladesh ("Amar Sonar Bangla"). Tagore was also a social reformer who renounced his British knighthood in 1919 to protest the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. He founded Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan to encourage cultural exchange. His legacy continues to inspire peace and creativity globally.

            Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose (23 January 1897 - 18 August 1945) was a towering, revolutionary leader of the Indian independence movement, known for his uncompromising, militant approach to freedom. Born in Cuttack, Odisha, he was a brilliant student who passed the prestigious Indian Civil Service exam but resigned in 1921 to join the freedom struggle, heavily influenced by Chittaranjan Das and Swami Vivekananda. Though elected Congress President twice, his radical vision for complete, immediate independence led to ideological differences with Mahatma Gandhi, prompting him to form the Forward Bloc in 1939. During World War II, believing that an armed struggle was necessary to expel the British, he made a daring escape from house arrest in 1941 to seek support from Axis powers in Germany and Japan. In 1943, he took command of the Indian National Army (INA) or Azad Hind Fauj in Southeast Asia, aiming to liberate India with the slogan "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!". Under his command, the INA, along with the provisional Azad Hind Government, marched toward India, though they were eventually forced to retreat following the defeat of Japan. Despite his tragic, disputed death in a 1945 plane crash, his actions sparked intense patriotism and contributed significantly to the British withdrawal from India.
